# Contributing to BOPPA

BOPPA is not currently accepting external contributions.

This organization is a tight team working on private and internal projects. If you're part of the team, read below.

## üí° Got an Idea? Start Here!

**Everyone can contribute - coding skills not required!**

### For New Project Ideas

If you have an idea for a completely new project, improvement, or solution:

1. **Visit our [Project-Proposals](https://github.com/BOPPALabs/Project-Proposals) repository**
2. **Create a new issue** using the `üí≠ MVP Proposal` template
3. **Share your idea** - the rest of the team will help with the technical details!

### For Existing Projects

If you want to suggest features, improvements, or report bugs for projects that already have their own dedicated repositories:

1. **Navigate to the specific project's repository**
2. **Create an issue** using the appropriate template:
   - `‚ú® Feature Request` for new features
   - `‚ö†Ô∏è Bug Report` if something isn't working as expected
3. **Describe your idea or issue** - no coding knowledge needed!

Your business insights, user experience ideas, and problem-solving perspectives are just as valuable as code. Many of our best projects started as non-technical ideas that sparked great technical solutions.

## üöÄ Getting Started (For Development)

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Set up your development environment** following the project's README
3. **Install dependencies** and ensure all tools are working
4. **Run tests** to make sure everything is working before you start

## üîÑ Development Workflow

We follow **GitHub Flow** for most projects:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits
3. Push your branch and create a Pull Request
4. Address any feedback from code review
5. Once approved, your PR will be merged

## üìù Code Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clear, readable code with meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic or business rules
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Follow the existing code style in the project

### Language-Specific Standards

#### Web Development (JavaScript/TypeScript)

- **Prettier** is required for code formatting
- Run `npm run format` or `yarn format` before committing
- Use modern ES6+ syntax when possible
- Follow semantic HTML practices

#### Python

- **Black** is required for code formatting
- Run `black .` before committing
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints when appropriate

### File Structure

- Keep related files organized in logical directories
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Include a README in each major directory explaining its purpose

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Unit Testing

- **All new features must include unit tests**
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just high percentages
- Test both happy paths and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested

### Test Commands

- JavaScript: `npm test` or `yarn test`
- Python: `pytest` or `python -m pytest`

### CI/CD

- All tests must pass before merging
- CI/CD pipelines are preferred when applicable
- Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

## üìã Commit Guidelines

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style:

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): brief description

Longer explanation if needed, including:
- What changed and why
- Any breaking changes
- Links to relevant issues
```

### Commit Types

- `feat:` - new feature
- `fix:` - bug fix
- `docs:` - documentation changes
- `test:` - adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - code refactoring

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add user login functionality

Implements basic email/password authentication with JWT tokens.
Includes input validation and error handling.

Closes #23
```

- **For questions**: Ask in PR comments, issue discussions, or team channels
- **For learning**: Document your process and ask for guidance from the team

## ü§ù Our Philosophy

We believe the best projects come from diverse perspectives. Whether you contribute code, ideas, feedback, or domain expertise, your input helps make our projects better. Don't hesitate to contribute just because you're not sure about the technical implementation - that's what the team is for!
