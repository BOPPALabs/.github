## 🔧 What We Do

At BOPPA, we’re focused on:

- 🚀 **MVPs** — Turning ideas into products, fast.
- 🛠️ **In-house Tools** — Building systems that make building better.
- 🧪 **Side Projects** — Testing concepts, workflows, and crazy ideas.

We work on a mix of private and public projects — some for the world, some just for us. But everything we build sharpens our edge.

---

## 👥 Who We Are

We’re a group of tinkerers with a shared love of knowledge pushing each other to improve as developers, designers, and problem-solvers. No fluff, just progress.

This isn't a company. It’s a creative alliance.
